Hi Professor,

My overwatch_teams.py script was supposed to be more fleshed out then it is, but Wikipedia made that really hard. My urls are inside the scripts inside the comments. If wikipedia had put some classnames on the td tags, I might of been able to do more with this. Please let me know if any questions.

Hi Professor,

Please use the apple_stock.py script instead of the old one. I'm keeping that around since I do save it to a csv file. My overwatch_teams.py script was supposed to be more fleshed out then it is, but Wikipedia made that really hard. My urls are inside the scripts inside the comments. If wikipedia had put some classnames on the td tags, I might of been able to do more with this. Please let me know if any questions.

Tim
